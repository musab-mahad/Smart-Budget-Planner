# Smart-Budget-Planner
Smart Budget Planner is a client-side financial management application that enables users to define a personalized budgeting rule (such as 50/30/20), track income, expenses, and savings, and view real-time financial summaries. The project demonstrates semantic HTML, responsive CSS design, DOM manipulation, and localStorage persistence.
