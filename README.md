## Project Description

This application helps users manage their personal finances in a simple and organized way.

When a user first opens the website, they are asked to:

- Enter their name

- Choose a currency symbol

- Set their own budgeting percentages (Needs, Wants, Savings) which must total 100%

Users can then:

- Add income transactions

- Add expense transactions

- Add savings transactions

- Edit and delete transactions

- View transactions in descending order (latest first)

- See automatic calculations based on their custom budgeting rule

All data is stored using localStorage, so information remains saved even after refreshing the page.
